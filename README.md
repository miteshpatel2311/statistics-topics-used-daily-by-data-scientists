focusing on applied (practical) statistics that are used day to day in the life of a data scientist


# ðŸ“Š Daily Statistics for Data Science  

Welcome to **Daily Statistics for Data Science** ðŸš€  
This repository is dedicated to practicing and mastering the **statistics topics most frequently used by data scientists** in their daily work.  

Statistics is the backbone of data science, and this repo will serve as my **study + practice space**, covering both theory and applied exercises.  

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals
- Strengthen **fundamentals of statistics** for data science  
- Practice with **real-world datasets**  
- Build a **daily routine** of problem-solving  
- Share knowledge in an organized, professional way
